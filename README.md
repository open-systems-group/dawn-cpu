# The Dawn RISC-V Processor Project

We aim to develop a synthesizable high performance open source RISC-V core. We have currently implemented an out of order unprivileged RV32I core with peripherals for interacting with UART and emitting VGA.

## Getting Started
You'll need [xpack-riscv-none-elf-gcc-15.2.0-1](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/releases/tag/v15.2.0-1) install locally in this git repository so that scripts can access it at the path `./xpack-riscv-none-elf-gcc-15.2.0-1/...`

The Nix flake is WIP and only supplies scala and verilator which is enough to build and run the core and simulation scripts manually.

Once your have your environment set up, you'll want to run `./scripts/generate-verilog.sh` to generate verilog for verilator to run. Then run `./scripts/simulate.sh` and pass in the path to the c program you wish to simulate. For example, `./scripts/simulate.sh ./programs/pong.c`. If you would like to simulate a premade bin, run `./scripts/sim_bin.sh /your/bin/here.bin`

The simulation will emit `frame.png` under the `./generated/` folder. The image is a recording of the VGA signal and an approximation of what you might see when connected to a real VGA cable. It won't be completely accurate because the VGA clock is triggered at the same speed as the processor clock in simulation, which may not be the case in reality.

### FPGA Testing
We provide a scaffold for a custom kintex ultrascale+ devboard. We also have tested on a Real Digital Urbana Board, hoesver newe designs might struggle to fit. Once the bitstream has been loaded onto the FPGA. Use `./scripts/load.sh /your/bin/here.bin` to load a bin onto the board.
